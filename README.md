# Project-Euler
This repo contains my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. These solutions are meant as a way to share both my logic and thinking as well as to solicit feedback from members of the community.

### What's the deal with main.m?

For the sake of pedagogy, each solution's' code usually centers around a class file (Problem##.h/.m) that is invoked from the project's main.m file. This is not how people normally develop iOS or Cocoa applications, or should be developing them, but it provides a great way of presenting a single big idea and focusing on the solution.

It's hard to tell a story when readers must look through many individual files at once - many of which deal with UI plumbing. Offering a single file starting point concentrates that story, allowing access to that idea in a single chunk.

### How to build these projects

You should be able to build and run these projects as they are console based apps for the simulator. Before compiling, make sure you select a deployment target using the pop-up menu at the top-left of the Xcode window.
