# Project-Euler: Problem 2 (Even Fibonacci numbers)
This repo contains my solution to the [second Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) problem. These solutions are meant as a way to share both my logic and thinking as well as to solicit feedback from members of the community.

###Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
